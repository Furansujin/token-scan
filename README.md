# Token Scan Prototype

Token-Scan is a prototype decentralized exchange (DEX) ERC20 Token scanner tailored for the Ethereum blockchain. This tool aims to simplify the complexities of navigating the decentralized ecosystem by offering users efficient scanning capabilities across multiple data sources. Please note that this version of the tool is a prototype.

## Introduction

Token-Scan prototype provides a fundamental functionality for scanning ERC20 tokens. It's built with modularity in mind, facilitating seamless integration of new scanning methods and offering insights into tokens listed on decentralized exchanges.

## Problem Statement

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have transformed the cryptocurrency landscape, providing users with the freedom to trade assets without reliance on traditional centralized intermediaries. However, the vast array of tokens listed on DEX platforms can present challenges. Identifying legitimate tokens, detecting potential scams or honeypots, and obtaining comprehensive intelligence on tokens of interest are essential tasks for developers and investors alike. Token-Scan prototype endeavors to tackle these challenges by providing a basic scanning tool capable of analyzing ERC20 tokens across various data sources.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Scanning**: Token-Scan prototype aggregates data from various sources to provide basic insights into ERC20 tokens.
- **Modular Architecture**: The project is structured with modularity in mind, allowing for easy integration of new scanning methods.
- **CLI Tool**: Token-Scan prototype offers a basic command-line interface (CLI) for convenient and straightforward usage.
- **GoLang Package**: Users can integrate Token-Scan prototype as a GoLang package to leverage its basic functionality within their projects.
- **Advanced Modules**: Additional scanners like source code checks, holder analysis, heuristics and fingerprinting are documented under `docs/`.

## Installation

To utilize Token-Scan prototype, follow the installation instructions below based on your preferred method:

### CLI Usage & Installation (for linux)

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/s-Amine/token-scan.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd token-scan
```

3. Run the executable:

```
./token-scan -mode <mode> -token <token_hash> [--pretty] [--score-only]
```

Replace `<mode>` with one of `multiscan`, `goplus`, `ishoneypot`, `quickIntel`, `sourcecheck`, `holders` or `fingerprint`. The optional flags `--pretty` enables coloured output and `--score-only` prints only the calculated risk score.


### GoLang Package Integration

1. Install the package:

```
go get github.com/s-Amine/token-scan
```

2. Import the package in your GoLang code:

```go
import "github.com/s-Amine/token-scan/scanners/<mode>"
```

Replace `<mode>` with the desired scanning mode (`multiscan`, `goplus`, `ishoneypot`, or `quickIntel`)

3. Utilize the package to instantiate structs and access scanning methods as needed.



### GoLang Package Usage

#### Multiscan Scan Usage
```go
import "github.com/s-Amine/token-scan/scanners/multiscan"

...

result, err := multiscan.Scan("<token_hash>")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error occurred during scan:", err)
    return
}
fmt.Println(result)
```

#### Quickintel Scan Usage

```go
import "github.com/s-Amine/token-scan/scanners/quickintel"

...

result, err := quickintel.Scan("<token_hash>")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error occurred during scan:", err)
    return
}
fmt.Println(result)
```

#### Is Honeypot Scan Usage

```go
import "github.com/s-Amine/token-scan/scanners/ishoneypot"

...

result, err := ishoneypot.Scan("<token_hash>")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error occurred during scan:", err)
    return
}
fmt.Println(result)
```
#### Goplus Scan Usage

```go
import "github.com/s-Amine/token-scan/scanners/goplus"

...

result, err := goplus.Scan("<token_hash>")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error occurred during scan:", err)
    return
}
fmt.Println(result)
```
